### View Project
Want to skip cloning this project and downloading all the dependencies?  As a quick option to view my app I used gh-pages to build and deploy my app.  This app can be seen here https://jnbostow.github.io/would-you-rather-project

### Description 
This project is a part of the Udacity React program.  Per course requirements, forked Udacity's starter code which only contains a psuedo database. Project was bootstrapped with create-react-app.  All React and Redux code was designed and implemented by me.

The app allows a list of pre-defined users to choose from two impossible choices.  The app allows a user to select a choice from posted questions, make a new question and displays a leaderboard.  App allows pre-defined users to log in and out.
