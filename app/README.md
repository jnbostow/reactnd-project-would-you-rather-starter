# Would You Rather Project

### Author: 
Jacki Bostow
### Description: 
This project is a part of the Udacity React program.  Per course requirements, forked Udacity's starter code which only contains a psuedo database. Project was bootstrapped with create-react-app.  All React and Redux code was designed and implemented by me.

The app allows a list of pre-defined users to choose from two impossible choices.  The app allows a user to select a choice from posted questions, make a new question and displays a leaderboard.  App allows pre-defined users to log in and out.
